# Network-Management-in-Critical-Cases-PPDR-Smart-Î•vacuation
This project was developed as part of the Network Management course at the University of Athens.
The assignment involves simulating an external and an internal network and demonstrating on each case
what whould happen at the networks, if a physical disaster occured and there is a failure/loss of a network node. 
Also, determine the appropriate network fault handling mechanisms to address the networking error that arises.
