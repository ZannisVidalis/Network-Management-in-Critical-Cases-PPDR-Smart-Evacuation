# Network-Management-in-Critical-Cases-PPDR-Smart-Î•vacuation
This project was developed as part of the Network Management course at the University of Athens.
The assignment involves simulating an external and an internal network and demonstrating on each case
what whould happen at the networks, if a physical disaster occured and there is a failure/loss of a network node. 
Also, we need to determine the appropriate network fault handling mechanisms to address the networking error that arises
, in order to minimize the impact and continue to provide the building evacuation assistance application for users at the site and connected to the corresponding network nodes

The explanation and the logic of the Mininet code and ThingsBoard are on this pdf. [ReadMe.pdf](file:///C:/Users/%CE%96%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%82/Desktop/NM_2000022_2000204/README.pdf)
